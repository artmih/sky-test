# SkyTV technical test

### How to launch
* Server `cd sky-server && npm start run`
* Client `cd sky-client && npm start run`

### Server
Made from scratch without any help of starter packs.
Not implemented because it was not mentioned(or overkill):
* Using https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-validator for express validation data.
* Using babel for ES6 to use features which node at the moment don't support(v6+)
* DB for catalogue

### Client
Made from scratch without any help of starter packs.
Not implemented because it was not mentioned(or overkill):
* Pagination (router module for react)
* Checkout page - is it clear stub or there is needs to have a separate page
